        <h1 id="sow">Sowing</h1>
            <p >Sowing or seeding is an art of placing seeds in the soil to have good germination in the ﬁeld. A perfect seeding gives correct amount of seed per unit area, correct depth at which seed is placed in the soil and correct spacing between row-to-row and plant to plant.
                Methods of sowing <br>
                There are diﬀerent methods of sowing such as Broadcasting, Dibbling, Drilling, Seed dropping behind the plough, Transplanting, Hill dropping and Check row planting.
                i) Broadcasting<br>
                Broadcasting is the process of random scattering of seed on the surface of seedbeds. It can be done manually or mechanically both. When broadcasting is done manually, uniformity of seed depends upon skill of the man. Soon after broadcasting the seeds are covered by planking or some other devices. Usually higher seed rate is obtained in this system. Mechanical broadcasters are used for large-scale work. This machine scatters the seeds on the surface of the seedbed at controlled rates.<br>
                ii) Dibbling <br>
                Dibbling is the process of placing seeds in holes made in seedbed and covering them. In this method, seeds are placed in holes made at deﬁnite depth at ﬁxed spacing. The equipment used for dibbling is called dibbler. It is a conical instrument used to make proper holes in the ﬁeld. Small hand dibblers are made with several conical projections made in a frame. This is very time consuming process, so it is not suitable for small seeds. Mostly vegetables are sown in this way.<br>
                iii) Drilling<br>
                Drilling consists of dropping the seeds in furrow lines in a continuous ﬂow and covering them with soil. Seed metering may be done either manually or mechanically. The number of rows planted may be one or more. This method is very helpful in achieving proper depth, proper spacing and proper amount of seed to be sown in the ﬁeld. Drilling can be done by (1) Sowing behind the plough (2) Bullock drawn seed drills (3) Tractor drawn seed drills.
                iv) Seed dropping behind the plough<br>
                It is very common method used in villages. It is used for seed like maize, gram, peas, wheat and barley. A man drops seeds in the furrow behind the plough. Sowing behind the plough can be done by a device known as malobansa. It consists of a bamboo tube provided with a funnel shaped mouth. One man drops the seeds through the funnel and other man handles the plough and the bullocks. This is a slow and laborious method.
                v) Transplanting<br>
                Transplanting consists of preparing seedlings in nursery and then planting these seedlings in the prepared ﬁeld. It is commonly done for vegetable and ﬂowers. It is very time consuming operation. Equipment for placing plants in the soil is called transplanter.
                vi) Hill dropping
                <br>
                In this method, seeds are dropped at ﬁxed spacing and not in a continuous stream. Thus the spacing between plant to plant in a row is constant. In case of drills, the seeds are dropped in continuous stream and the spacing between plant to plant in a row is not constant.<br>
                vii) Check row planting<br>
                It is a method of planting, in which row-to-row and plant-to-plant distance is uniform. In this method, seeds are planted precisely along straight parallel furrows. The rows are always in two perpendicular directions. A machine used for check row planting is called check row planter.

    <h1 id="land">Land Preparation</h1>
<p >Once a suitable area for establishing the plantation is selected and the planning operation is ﬁ nalised, the actual preparation can be activated. These activities are divided to structure and pace the implementation process in order to be ready for planting at the most suitable time, according to the speciﬁ c regional climatic conditions.
2.1 Mechanical ﬁeld preparation
The mechanical or initial soil preparation concerns mainly the preparation of a ﬁ eld for further detailed preparation such as irrigation system installation, hole preparation, etc. Actions, if applicable to the area, include:
(i) debushing/bush clearing;
(ii) removal of stones and rocks;
(iii) ripping; and
(iv) levelling of the soil.
2.2 Irrigation system installation
The type of irrigation system to be used will be determined by the availability of water, topographical and soil conditions. When the initial soil preparation is completed, the installation of the required irrigation system will be implemented according to the prescribed design (Figure 55).
In saline soils (soluble salts present as chlorides, sulphates and/or carbonates of calcium, sodium or magnesium), only leaching will be necessary to drain the excess salts. In the case of alkaline and/or salinealkaline soils, sodium can be replaced through the application of gypsum or acidifying agents like sulphur. Once the sodium has been replaced, a programme should be followed to leach it out.
When the irrigation water is of poor quality, proper drainage and over irrigation, without the development of a water table, is very important.
Hole preparation
The actual digging of the hole is one of the last actions before planting takes place, but it must be emphasised that this is not the ﬁ nal preparation for the planting operation itself. This is the point where the required inputs such as gypsum and organic materials are worked into the soil and a start is made with the leaching programme. The reason why the leaching is only applied at 
this stage is because of the relatively small area that is occupied by the date palm. If the total area had to be leached, it would become very costly with little or no beneﬁ t in the long run.
It is recommended that a hole of 1 m³ be prepared and that the soil from the hole be mixed with the organic material and gypsum (Figures 56 and 57). The soil mix is then put back into the hole, whereafter the site is clearly marked for positioning of the small date palm plants.
At this stage, once the hole has been prepared and closed, it is irrigated and a leaching programme implemented. The water supply will then enhance the leaching of excessive salts and contribute to the fermentation process of the organic material. Subsequent irrigation, several times (2 to 3) before planting, will also allow the mixed soil to settle in the hole.
In most soils, the early and rapid growth of the date plant is better when the holes are prepared one to two months before planting. Well-rotted manure can also be used in holes prepared and irrigated shortly before planting, but extreme care must be taken to put the manure (and fertilisers) deep enough to allow a layer of soil at least 15 to 20 cm thick to be placed between the manure and the roots of the date plant.</p>
